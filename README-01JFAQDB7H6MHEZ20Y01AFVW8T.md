## **CI/CD Pipeline Workflow**

The CI/CD pipeline automates:

1. Testing (unit, integration, and security).
2. Building the tool.
3. Running vulnerability scans with **Trivy**.
4. Linting shell scripts with **ShellCheck**.
5. Tagging new versions based on semantic versioning.
6. Uploading the build artifact as `file_tool.tar.gz`.
